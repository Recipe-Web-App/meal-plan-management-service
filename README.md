```

## ü§ñ Automated Dependency Management

This project uses **GitHub Dependabot** to automatically keep dependencies up to date. Dependabot will:

- üì¶ Monitor npm dependencies daily
- üê≥ Check Docker base images weekly
- üîÑ Group related dependencies for easier management
- üè∑Ô∏è Create well-labeled pull requests
- üîí Prioritize security updates

For more details, see [`.github/DEPENDABOT.md`](.github/DEPENDABOT.md).

## ‚ö° GitHub Actions & Workflows

This project includes a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline with automated workflows for:

- üîç **Security Scanning**: CodeQL, secret detection, vulnerability scanning
- üß™ **Testing & Quality**: Automated tests, code coverage, performance testing
- üì¶ **Build & Deploy**: Docker builds, semantic releases, environment deployments
- üìä **Monitoring**: Database migrations, health checks, performance metrics
- ü§ñ **Automation**: Issue management, auto-labeling, dependency updates

For complete workflow documentation, see [`.github/WORKFLOWS.md`](.github/WORKFLOWS.md).

## Deployment

When you're ready to deploy your NestJS application to production, there are some key steps you can take to ensure it
runs as efficiently as possible. Check out the [deployment documentation](https://docs.nestjs.com/deployment) for more
information.

If you are looking for a cloud-based platform to deploy your NestJS application, check out
[Mau](https://mau.nestjs.com), our official platform for deploying NestJS applications on AWS. Mau makes deployment
straightforward and fast, requiring just a few simple steps:

```bash
npm install -g @nestjs/mau
mau deploy
```

With Mau, you can deploy your application in just a few clicks, allowing you to focus on building features rather than
managing infrastructure.

## Authentication & Security

This service implements a comprehensive OAuth2 authentication system with JWT tokens:

### üîê Authentication Methods

- **JWT Authentication**: OAuth2 with JWT tokens using passport-jwt
- **Service-to-Service**: Client credentials flow for microservice communication
- **Token Validation**: Supports both local JWT validation and introspection

### üõ°Ô∏è Security Features

- Bearer token authentication on all protected endpoints
- Configurable OAuth2 with multiple validation strategies
- Rate limiting with multiple tiers (short/medium/long term)
- Helmet security headers and CORS protection
- Request correlation IDs for tracing

### üìñ API Authentication

All API endpoints (except health checks) require Bearer token authentication:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
     https://api.example.com/api/v1/meal-plans
```

For detailed authentication setup and configuration, see [`docs/AUTHENTICATION.md`](./docs/AUTHENTICATION.md).

## API Documentation

Interactive API documentation is available at `/docs` when running the service:

- **Swagger UI**: Complete API reference with authentication
- **Try it out**: Test endpoints directly from the browser
- **OpenAPI spec**: Full specification with security definitions

## Architecture & Features

### üèóÔ∏è Core Technologies

- **Framework**: NestJS with TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
- **Authentication**: OAuth2 + JWT with Passport.js
- **Validation**: Class-validator with DTO patterns
- **Documentation**: OpenAPI/Swagger with full schemas

### üì¶ Key Modules

- **Meal Plans**: CRUD operations with advanced filtering and view modes
- **Authentication**: OAuth2 guards, strategies, and token management
- **Health Monitoring**: Database and service health endpoints
- **Database**: Prisma integration with connection pooling and retry logic

### üéØ API Features

- RESTful endpoints with consistent response format
- Comprehensive filtering, sorting, and pagination
- Multiple view modes (full, day, week, month)
- Detailed error responses with correlation IDs
- Rate limiting with configurable tiers
